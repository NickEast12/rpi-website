              Modern slavery is a criminal offence under the Modern Slavery Act
              2015 (the “Act”). It can occur in various forms, including
              servitude, forced or compulsory labor and human trafficking, all
              of which have in common the deprivation of a person’s liberty by
              another to exploit them for personal or commercial gain.
